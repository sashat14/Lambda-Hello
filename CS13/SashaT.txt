My name is Kinshasa Taylor, Sasha for short.  I live in Chicago.  I think 
three words to describe me would be ambitious, analytical, and kind.  
Healthy cooking is a hobby of mine.  I love to recreate reciepes using healthy
ingredients.  As far as animals go I like dogs more than cats but I have a cat.
:/  lol

The opposite of me would be impulsive and judgmental.  A hobby that I don't
participate in, is watching sports or fantasy football.
